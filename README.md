1. press 'i' to initialize baxter's pose 
2. click any point on the RGB image of the camera window 
3. press 'c' to set the point as a start point
4. click another point on the RGB image and press 'v' to set the point as a goal point.
5. Finally, press '5'.
6. If the netwokr is loaded properly, baxter's right arm will move from the start point to the goal point. (maybe :))
7. all the other keys are for data collection
